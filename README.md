# Sweet Retreat - a Bakery Website
This repository contains the complete code for a ***front-end only*** model of a multi-page website for a bakery made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and Bootstrap.


## About the project

On opening the `Homepage.html`, you'll reach the homepage for the website. There, you'll see a navigation bar on top which links to all other pages, a 
user icon and a cart icon. Moving down, you'll see some special deals, a brief about us, a map etc.
